# 5to6

This repo is the code base for my talk about transforming an Angular app from ES5 to ES6.

The application is about listing brewery and beers with data from http://www.brewerydb.com/.

The `master` branch is the code base in ES5.

In the `es6` branch, you'll find the code transformed in ES6 with Babel.

In the `parisweb` branch, you'll find the exact code I wrote on stage at Paris Web.

In the branch `slides` and `gh-pages` there will be the slides.

You can find slides online at http://swiip.github.io/5to6/
