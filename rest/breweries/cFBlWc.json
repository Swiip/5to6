  "description": "The Chimay Brewery is a Belgian brewery founded inside Scourmont Abbey, in the Belgian municipality of Chimay in 1862. The brewery produces three widely distributed ales and a patersbier exclusively for the monks; they are known as Trappist beers because they are made in a Trappist monastery. The brewing plant was updated in 1988, and as of 2005 produced 120,000 hectolitres annually.\r\n\r\nSince 1876 the monastery has also made cheese, and currently offers four cheeses.",
