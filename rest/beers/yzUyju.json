Very robust and rich in tannins, which warrants a bit of extra maturation in the bottle to let the complexity increase and the flavour become rounder. While the red wine influence is noticable, the wood has the dominant note. A must for everyone who likes heavy beer and\/or wine with lots of wood flavour and aroma. 55% Used Malbec barrels 20% New French oak, medium toast 20% New French oak, high toast 5% Acacia wood.",

These barrels come from different whiskey distilleries such as Bowmore, Tamdhu, Strathspey and Laphroaig (Johnstons). The aroma\u2019s of the whiskeys have an obvious impact on the final flavor. This flavor is remarkable and clearly different from those of previous batches. Peat and burnt are more present, while wood and wood tannins are less obvious to spot. But the warming effect of the full, robust flavor the whiskey barrels passed on to our already beautiful Quadrupel, makes this batch maybe even the most tasty brewed to date.",

    "description": "American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color. Roasted malt caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma. American brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma, medium to high hop bitterness, and a medium body. Estery and fruity-ester characters should be subdued. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",
